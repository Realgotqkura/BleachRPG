# BleachRPG - The Definitive Bleach progression plugin

**BleachRPG** is a minecraft plugin that aims to be an in-depth progression rpg type plugin based on the anime Bleach.
Have in mind the plugin is **still in development** and it will be for a long time. In this readme you will learn what is done and what will be in the plugin and also what is currently in development. 
In the end you would be able to develop your own parts and it will act as a sort of a framework of sorts so it won't just be a basic plugin.
